## Django Articles Website: "Da Fool"

**Overview**

    This is a Django 2.2 example app featuring a homepage + article page. Article pages display article content retireved from a fake API and stock quote tickers from another fake API, as well as a Commenting feature providing the ability to post and delete comments as unauthenticated user. This commenting feature is a basic CRUD system built with Django models.

**Installation**
 
1. Clone this repo and navigate into the `dafool` directory
2. Crate and activate a virtualenv for this project (I used pipenv, a simplified virtual environment manager that work son Unix and Windows systems).
3. Run `./setup.sh` instide the `dafool` directory
