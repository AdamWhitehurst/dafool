## Django Articles Website: "Da Fool"

**Overview**

    This is a Django 2.2 example app featuring a homepage + article page. Article pages display article content retireved from a fake API and stock quote tickers from another fake API, as well as a Commenting feature providing the ability to post and delete comments as unauthenticated user. This commenting feature is a basic CRUD system built with Django models.

**Installation**
 
Make sure [`pipenv`](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) is installed (this is a simplified virtualenvironment manager that works on both Unix and Windows systems):

    pip install pipenv
